Threat,Description
1,Time to break into the barrens castle! He'll have plenty of armed guards at the ready.
1,I sure hope no bandits decide to raid our caravan tomorrow!
1,"After last night's bar brawl, the local authorities don't seem very happy with us..."
1,The barren is advancing his armies. A new wave of mercenaries is approaching.
1,Gah. Their armor is improving. Orcs in noble armor! Who woulda thunk it?
1,What is this world coming to? The barren is spilling innocent blood in the streets.
1,We were jumped by a few more of the barren's henchmen today. In our sleep. They never stood a chance!
1,It's time to take the barren HEAD ON!
2,I can't believe the wizard turned the mayor into a chicken. How cliche.
2,The legion of the undead is no match for the might of Abadar!
2,At least the wizard seems to be leaving some enchanted items around. 
2,"So the sword spoke and almost convinced me to murder you; Bala'r, I'm sorry, but it really wasn't my fault!"
2,That fire magic gets a little toasty at times...
2,"Blood magic is just unfair. Pretty badass, but unfair."
2,"Jera, the local priest said the blindness and deafness will wear off so-... Oh. Right. Deafness."
2,I wish we could just poke him with the pointy end like every other baddy we go against.
3,"Think about it this way, the bear trap gave you a new nickname, Nine-Toes!"
3,I still can't believe we convinced him we were health inspectors. Does this village even have health inspectors?
3,Those guards really need to learn who their co-workers are.
3,"I didn't exactly expect him to be able to teleport across the shadows like that. Seriously, what kind of rogue is he?"
3,"I miss getting stabbed; I can heal wounds, but pickpocketing? Rude."
3,The local extortion has to stop. Extorted villagers give bad quest rewards. 
3,"I'd love to buy a nice stealthy wrist-crossbow. Oh, you don't have those? Well. How about that."
3,"If we can infiltrate the crime syndicate, we can take then out from the inside."
